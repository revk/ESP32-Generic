# ESP32-Generic

Software and hardware for generic ESP32 usage. Software based on ESP32-RevK library.

The software is all sorts of mish mash of stuff, mainly to demo things. Can work with an e-paper display to show messages. Has simple input reporting and output with pulses and counts, etc. Can even work DEFCON lights mode, or debug dump serial data each way to a Daikin air-con controller. Basically it ends up with any little project that I don't think deserves its own project yet.

# Building

Git clone this `--recursive` to get all the submodules, and it should build with just `make`. That actually runs the normal `idf.py` to build. `make menuconfig` can be used to fine tune the settings, but the defaults should be mostly sane. `make flash` should work to program.

# Hardware

Various KiCad designs, with 3D printed case designs.

## Generic S3 board

- USB-C flash/debug/power
- DC 5V-17V
- All GPIOs
- WS2812 on GPIO 0

## ESP01 Style ESP32 board

- Even smaller than ESP01 (13.2mm x 23.4mm including antenna)
- Same pin out (though RST is just a GPIO on this)
- No USB or voltage regulator - works from 3.3V and needs programming via Tx/Rx/GPIO0 pins, just like ESP01

## ESP32-Generic

- Very small size (29mm x 19mm PCB, plus antenna)
- ESP32-WROOM-32 design
- 6 pin connector (SPOX 2.5mm or 0.1"), which are GND and 5xGPIO
- Pads to allow linking one pin to DC supply (and not linking to GPIO)
- Pads to allow linking other pins to 3.3V, e.g. pull ups, or to power somethign external
- Pad to allow linking one pin to GND, e.g. capacitor
- USB-C connection for power and also debug/serial.
- Alternative external DC supply 4V to 60V (safe to connect at same time as USB-C)
- On board RGB LED.

## ESP32-Generic2

- Larger PCB (35.5mm x 22.5mm, plus antenna)
- ESP32-WROOM-32 design
- Two 8 pin connectors (SPOX 2.5mm or 0.1"), which are all connected to GPIO
- Pad (pre-bridged) linking one pin on each side to GND, can be cut
- Pad allowing one pin to link to DC supply (need to cut the series pad to disconnect from GPIO)
- Pad allowing one pin to link to 3.3V, e.g. pull up, or to power somethign external

## ESP32-Generic3

- Larger PCB (35mm x 21.5mm, plus antenna)
- ESP32-PICO-MINI based design
- 2 pin connector for DC (SPOX 2.5mm or 0.1")
- 10 pin GPIO connector (SPOX 2.5mm or 0.1")
- Pads to allow a GPIO to be tied to GND and one to be tied to 3.3V to power a separate device if needed
- USB-C connection for power and also debug/serial.
- Alternative external DC supply 4V to 60V (safe to connect at same time as USB-C)
- On board RGB LED
- A buzzer connection, as separate pads on back of board, with FET drive and back EMF diode

## ESP32-Generic4

General purpose small board for use from DC supply not USB

- Tiny board! (13.2mm x 19.5mm, plus antenna)
- Designed to work with simple 4 pin SPOX (GND, DC, 2xGPIO), or additional 0.1" headers making total of 10 GPIO (including GPIO0)
- Note the first 5 0.1" pins are GND, GPIO0, 3.3V, Rx (to module), Tx (from module) so match a Shelly 1, and so can work with Shelly Tasmotizer board.
- DC is 4V to 60V

## ESP32-Generic5

General purpose small board for use from USB, including passing 5V to connected device (Display, LED strip, etc, etc).

- Tiny board (12.5mm x 21mm, with antenna on side)
- USB connection
- RGb LED
- 4 pin SPOX connector can be all GPIO
- Pin 1 can be linked to GND
- Pin 2 can be unlinked from GPIO and linked to USB 5V supply
- Pin 3 has addition FET on separate GPIO to drive 3.3V supply, and a back EMF diode, allowing drive of buzzer, etc.

## ESP32-LowPower

Same as ESP32-Generic but for low power battery working.

- FET switched potential divide for ADC reading battery supply.
- Can work with USB chip disabled (power via DC connector instead)
- Approx 35uA on 9V battery in sleep mode
- USB-C connection for power and also debug/serial.
- Alternative external DC supply 4V to 60V (safe to connect at same time as USB-C)
- On board RGB LED.

## ESP32-USBA

Unlike the rest this is a much simpler PCB, PCB designed for direct plug in to USB-A socket.

- RGB LED
- Button
